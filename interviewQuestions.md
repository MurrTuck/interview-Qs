### HTML/CSS:
* **What is a selector in CSS?**
    * CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. 
    * We can break up the CSS selectors into five categories:
        * Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
        * Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
        * Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on certain state)
        * Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
        * Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


#### CSS element Selector Examples 
```
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

```
